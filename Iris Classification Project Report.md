Iris Classification Project Report

Objective:
The objective of this project is to classify Iris flower species based on morphological features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm.

Data:
The dataset used in the Iris dataset from sklearn, which consists of 150 samples of Iris flowers divided into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

Methodology:
- Data Splitting: The dataset was split into 80% for training and 20% for testing.
- Modelling: The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm was used with k=3. The model was trained and tested to evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Results:
- Accuracy: 100%
- Precision: 100%
- Recall: 100%
- F1-score: 100%

A confusion matrix visualization indicates that the model correctly classified the species, with no misclassifications.

Conclusion:
The KNN model demonstrates excellent performance in classifying Iris species. Future work could involve further hyperparameter tuning or trying other algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Decision Trees for comparison.
